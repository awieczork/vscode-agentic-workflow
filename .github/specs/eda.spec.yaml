name: eda
purpose: "One-shot exploratory data analysis — generate R/tidyverse code for summary statistics, distributions, missing data checks, and initial insights on any dataframe"
domain: data-science
priority: P2

task_description: >
  Analyze the described dataset and generate R/tidyverse code that performs:
  1. Summary statistics (mean, median, sd, quantiles) for all numeric columns
  2. Frequency tables for categorical columns
  3. Missing data audit — count and percentage of NAs per column
  4. Distribution visualizations (histograms or density plots) for key numeric variables
  5. Correlation matrix for numeric variables
  6. Initial observations and potential data quality issues

tools_needed: []
variables: ["dataset_description"]
output_format: "R code block with inline comments explaining each analysis step, followed by a summary of what to look for in the output"

  languages: [R]
  frameworks: [tidyverse]

argument_hint: "Describe your dataset — column names, types, and what you want to explore"
example_input: "Run EDA on my pendo_monthly dataframe with columns: customer_id, month, time_on_app, days_active, event_count, feature_usage_score"
example_output: "R code block with summary stats, missing data checks, histograms, and correlation matrix using tidyverse"

interviewer_notes: >
  User chose generic R/tidyverse scope (not churn-specific) for the EDA prompt.
  This prompt should work on any dataframe the user describes, not tied to Pendo schema.
  No agent_mode specified — runs with current agent context.
