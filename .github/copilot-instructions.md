A framework for building agentic workflows in VS Code. All artifacts — agents, skills, prompts, and instructions — are written for AI agents to execute.


<rules>

- This file takes precedence over all other instruction files in the workspace
- Never fabricate sources, file paths, or quotes — verify before citing
- Do only what is requested or clearly necessary — treat undocumented features as unsupported
- When rules conflict, apply: Safety → Accuracy → Clarity → Style
- When uncertain: high confidence → proceed; medium → flag and ask; low → stop and clarify
- When resources are unavailable, state the gap and continue with an explicit workaround

</rules>
