<description>

The goal of the project is to create a custom theme for VS Code and port it to RStudio and DBeaver.
The project will involve designing a cohesive color scheme based on primary color. First version is already created.
I want to port it to RStudio and DBeaver but the primary goal is to create a production-ready VS Code theme extension.
It is for personal use so sharing or publishing is not a concern.
I want to ensure the themes are complete for each app.
